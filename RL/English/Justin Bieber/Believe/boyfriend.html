If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I can take you places you ain't never been before
Baby take a chance or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I don't know 'bout me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three two

I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go

Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight yeah, you already know
I am 'ma a make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the, world ends
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook like a whirl wind swaggie

I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go

So give me a chance, 'cause you're all I need girl
Spend a week wit' your boy I'll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man, I'd never leave you girl
I just want to love you, if I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go (and treat you right)
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go

Na na na na na na na na na yeah girl,
Na na na na na na na na na, if I was your boyfriend
Na na na na na na na na na hey
Na na na na na na na na na, if I was your boyfriend
