believe, believe, believe

I don't know how I got here
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
(Believe) believe, yeah

There were days when I was just broken, you know
There were nights when I was doubting myself
But you kept my heart from foldin'
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
And just look at us now

'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?

Where would I be if you, if you
If you didn't believe
Would you know how it feels (oh)
To touch the sky if you didn't believe?
Believe, believe, yeah, oh

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
And just look at us now

'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me

'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?

Where would I be if you, yeah
If you didn't believe
Would you know how it feels
To touch the sky, yeah, if you didn't believe?
(Believe, believe) where would I be
Oh, if you didn't believe?
