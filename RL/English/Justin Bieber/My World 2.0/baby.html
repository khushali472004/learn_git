Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playin'
We're just friends, what are you sayin'
Said there's another, look right in my eyes
My first love, broke my heart for the first time

And I was like baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool
But I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me, 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I can't just believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks (woo)
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She know she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

I'm gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (now I'm all gone)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (now I'm all gone)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (now I'm all gone)
Gone, gone, gone, I'm gone
